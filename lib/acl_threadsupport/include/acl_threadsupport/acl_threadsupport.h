/// Implementation details.
//
// The very tricky part is that the signaler can only use
// semaphore-increment, and therefore *does not have a lock*.
//
// See
// Andrew D. Birrell, Implementing Condition Variables with Semaphores (2003).
// https://web.archive.org/web/20091122223051/http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/64242/implementingcvs.pdf
// It's very instructive, but we can't use its implementation because:
//    - The signaler acquires a mutex
//    - It keeps an explicit linked list of waiters
//
// But we can reuse much of the thinking.  If you've read the paper, then
// the twist we use is that instead of having an explicit list of waiters,
// we'll implicitly segregate waiters into groups by having them wait on
// different counter-based wakeup semaphores.  Also, we implicitly choose a
// "designated waker" as being the first waiter in its group.
//
// Secondly, we only support broadcast signalling.
//
//
// Description of the solution:
//
// A "potential waiter" is a thread that may want exclusive access to
// some shared client state, but needs to be woken up whenever a signal
// is generated.
//
// A potential waiter is in one of four states, as below.
// Only one potential waiter at a time can make a transition out of state A.
// Only one potential waiter at a time can make a transition out of state B.
//
//    A: Initial state.
//       Before acquire.
//       Actions:
//          acquire:  Move to state B.
//
//    B: Acquired.
//       Only one potential waiter can be in this state.
//       It can look at shared data to determine whether to wait or release.
//       Actions:
//          release:  Move to state A.
//          wait:  Become an active waiter (move to state C)
//             or  become a passive waiter (move to state D)
//
//    C: Active waiter.
//       This is the "Paul Revere" of its cohort, the first of its waiting
//       group. It is a waiter who needs to wait for the signal to come by. When
//       that happens, it will signal all current passive waiters to wake up.
//       Actions:
//          wake up:
//                Signal a wakeup for all passive waiters in my group,
//                   (This completes delivery of the signal)
//                Move to state A.
//
//    D: Passive waiter.
//       Actions:
//          wake up:  Move to state A.
//
// A "group of waiters" is the set of threads which transition from
// B->C or B->D between two events:
//    Between "init" and the complete delivery of the first signal, or
//    Between complete delivery of two successive signals, or
//    Between complete delivery of a signal and "reset".
//
// How does a thread know whether it should be the active or passive
// waiter?  The active waiter is always the *first* waiter in its group.
// All others are passive waiters.

struct acl_condvar_s {

  // We need to maintain *two* semaphores for passive waiters to account
  // for the fact that passive waiters may be scheduled by the OS in an
  // arbitrary order.  We want to keep the promise that a wakeup signal
  // will be delivered to *all* passive waiters in the same group
  // as the active waiter.
  //
  // So we steer each passive waiter into one of two queues: one that
  // has the same group as the active waiter, or a different group to
  // be awoken by the next active waiter to come along.
  //
  // This handles the following scenario (e.g. where entry_q starts out as 0):
  //    - After getting the async wakeup from the signal semaphore,
  //    the active waiter in group 0 raises the semaphore for all the passive
  //    waiters in group 0.
  //    - But then before the scheduler wakes them all up
  //    another group of waiters can start to accumulate, including a few
  //    passive waiters in group 1.
  //    - The passive waiters in group 0 should all have been signalled
  //    before any passive waiters in group 1 are signaled.
